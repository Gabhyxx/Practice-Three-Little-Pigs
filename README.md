# Practice: The Three Little Pigs
## About this project

This in an excercise for ESMAL3 Bootcamp. In this excercise, i've told the story of "The Three Little Pigs", in a webpage. Based on HTML5, i've put in the head of the file, a title with the name of the webpage "The Three Little Pigs", and linked my style CCS file.
Then, in the body, i started to tell the story. First, i've added an H1, with the title of the story, and an H2, for the actual beggining of the story. After that, i've divided the header from the main body. and placed a cover picture, aligned at the horizontal center of the webpaage. The story itself is placed on paragraphs.
Finally, on the footer, i've finished my story with a classical "The End".

Speaking about styles, i've made it simple. Firstly, i've used Courier New as font, and game a margin of 10 pixels in the whole project. Then, i've changed some colours. the H1 is on a crimson background, while the H2 is on a tomato red colour, with white letters. Finally, i gave the image a width of 250 pixels.
