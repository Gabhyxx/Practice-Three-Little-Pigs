            <p>
                There was three pig brothers, that decided to build their own houses. The first pig, the laziest of them, made it from hay, and it took him very little time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second pig, the strongest of them, made it out of wood. And the third brother, who was the smartest, build it out of bricks.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, an angry wolf showed up on the first pig's house. Then, he blew once, and destroyed it in no time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, he walked to the second pig's house. He blew, and couldn't destroy it, but he blew stronger, and destroyed it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, he arrived on the third house, and he tried to destroy it. He blew, and couldn't, and again and again, but all his efforts were in vain.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he left, the three pig brothers celebrated happily, and lived on the brick house.
